The University of Oklahoma Libraries offers numerous workshops throughout the year, with topics ranging from knitting to automating repetitive tasks using the programming language R.

===

Whatever your interests (or needs), there are likely at least a few workshops you would find interesting and/or useful. You can check out the [OU Libraries calendar](https://libraries.ou.edu/calendar-node-field-event-date/month) to see what events and workshops are coming up. Make sure to check back regularly to see what new events may have been scheduled.

Don't see a workshop you want? See a workshop you want that isn't offered at a good time? View our [list of on-request workshops](https://libraries.ou.edu/content/university-libraries-request-workshops). For most of these, as long as five people plan to attend we will schedule one for you. The Carpentry workshops are an exception, as they are very long (2 8-hour days). They require a minimum of fifteen participants.

If we have a workshop you are interested in that is not listed as an on-request workshop, or if you don't see a workshop on something that you want to learn, please [contact us](https://libraries.ou.edu/content/contact-us) and let us know! Your feedback can help inform our future directions, and we may be able to direct you to relevant resources, if nothing else.
