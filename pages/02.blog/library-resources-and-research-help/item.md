If you have looked for a book at OU Libraries, chances are you have used the Discover box at the top of the main library website. Sometimes, however, this is not the most efficient way to find what you are looking for.

===

Oftentimes research requires a bit more specificity in searching. For example, you may need to find articles that fit some particular criteria to be useful for your study or paper. In these cases, a Discover search may be too general. You may find it more helpful to check out our [Databases & E-Reference](https://libraries.ou.edu/eresources), which provides access to a wide variety of databases.

Not sure what database to use? There are so many options that it can easily become overwhelming. For more general article searching, I typically start with Academic Search Primiere, EBSCO, JSTOR, or ProQuest. However, we have other resources available to help you choose. You can start by checking out our [research guides](https://libraries.ou.edu/guides-index) linked to from the library website, or by going to [guides.ou.edu](https://guides.ou.edu/home). Here you can look up the subject you are researching and see what databases we recommend, as well as get information on other potential sources of information or tips for how to find what you need.

For additional research help, visit the Learning Lab on Lower Level One of Bizzell Memorial Library, [contact us](https://libraries.ou.edu/content/contact-us), or contact/schedule an appointment with your subject librarian.
