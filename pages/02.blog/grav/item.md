## What is Grav?

To quote the Grav documentation:

> Grav is a **Fast**, **Simple**, and **Flexible** file-based Web-platform.
> 

===

If you have heard of Wordpress, Grav is very similar. It streamlines website building, allowing users to create their own without requiring previous coding knowledge or experience.

!!! The Grav documentation is very extensive. It is available **[here](https://learn.getgrav.org/16**).
