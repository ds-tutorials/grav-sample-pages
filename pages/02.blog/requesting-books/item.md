Have you ever found the perfect book or article, only to run into issues actually obtaining it from the library? Sooner Xpress and ILL may be able to help.

===

If you are looking for a resource the library owns, most likely your issue is either that, although it is supposed to be on the shelf, you cannot find it, or that it is currently checked out. You should first make certain that you are looking in the right place - check the Discover search results to see where the book is listed. If it isn't in the main library stacks it might be in a branch library, Special Collections, or Reserves. Special Collections books are non-circulating, but you can read them while you are at the library. Reserve books are placed there at the request of professors who will be requiring them for class. These books have a four hour checkout time, which means that, while you can't take it home with you for weeks on end, it will actually be available a lot more often.

Assuming the book is not in Special Collections or Reserves, you can request it via Sooner Xpress. The option to do this will be on the Discover page for the book. You can specify which library you want to pick it up from, and you will be notified by email when it is ready for you. This is great for reserving a popular book with a waiting list, for reserving a book when you don't come to the library very often, or for reserving a book you are having trouble finding.

If the resource you are looking for is not one we have access to, you can make an InterLibrary Loan (ILL) request. Even if you do not go to OU, many libraries participate in ILL, so check with your local library. You may realize you have access to a lot more books and articles than you thought you did! Before filling out an ILL request, make sure that you are not requesting a textbook or something we already have access to. For example, if we have a book on Reserve or in Special Collections, ILL will probably deny the request.

If you have any questions, please [contact us](https://libraries.ou.edu/content/contact-us). We are always happy to help you get access to the resources you want or need.
