Did you know you can check out a telescope at Bizzell Memorial Library? 

===

The Orion StarBlast 4.5" reflector telescope is the preferred telescope of the [Library Telescope Program](https://www.astroleague.org/content/library-telescope-program). This program helps public libraries across the U.S. obtain telescopes their patrons can check out. The program advocates for a series of key modifications to make these telescopes library-friendly right out of the box, and libraries not affiliated with the program are still able to purchase the telescopes.

OU Libraries has a rich technology lending program, which now includes astronomy equipment like the telescope. For more information about telescope lending, check out [this guide](http://guides.ou.edu/telescope).
