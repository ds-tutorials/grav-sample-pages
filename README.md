How to use these files

1. Complete the base tutorial up to Creating Sample Posts under Creating Content.
2. Instead of making the posts as shown, download the zip file _pages_.
3. Go to create.ou.edu and open the _file manager_. (Ignore this if you installed grav elsewhere.)
4. Navigate to your grav install directory and go to the _user_ folder.
5. Upload the zip file.
6. Replace the current _pages_ folder with the extracted zip file.
